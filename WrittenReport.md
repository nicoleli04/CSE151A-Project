# WORK IN PROGRESS #

## Introduction ##

Prior to our first group meeting, all members were responsible for thinking of an idea and finding datasets that might be useful for that idea. A group member came up with an idea to create a Skincare related project, and the rest of the group was interested in moving forward with the idea. The datasets the member found were presented and seemed promising, as they (at the time) seemed large enough to work with, containing columns detailing brand, product name, price, reviews, country of origin, and other information related to the product. Doing a topic on Skincare seemed like a unique topic that our members were interested in working with, and we were leaning towards creating a recommendation system that presented products based on a user's response to a survey, where we'd ask them for things like skin type, ingredients, allergens, and specific skin issues that they would want to address like dryness, acne, and so on. In our minds, we were to make a model that was meant to predict what product would be the best for our user to use. 

We were unsure of what exact model we would want to use, as a recommendation system was not yet covered in the class, and we realized that we would have to do individual research and attend office hours to get a better grasp of how to approach the project. At office hours, Professor Solares told us that we would have to find a way to vectorize our data, and emphasized the importance of reviews in our process.
