# Skincare Recommender System

## Abstract
Taking care of oneâ€™s skin is essential for both physical and mental wellbeing. Our model aims to create a recommender system that suggests products aligned with users' skincare concerns through a quick survey. We will use explciit feedback like reviews from other users to identify suitable skincare products. Using datasets from Ulta and Sephora, we acknowledge potential biases in our model, such as the exclusion of lesser-known products, a focus on products used primarily by Westerners, and a predominance of data representing women or female-identifying individuals. Despite these biases, our ultimate goal is to enhance accessibility and knowledge of skincare for people of all skin types who aspire to improve their skincare routine.
